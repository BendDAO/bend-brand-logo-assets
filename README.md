## Introduction 
BendDAO is pretty open minded and flexible with our icon, but not our name.

We encourage creators to make derivative artworks based on the icon, and tbh we wanna see the community get real weird with it. If you’re selling derivative works, please give attribution and make sure you follow the guidelines here carefully so we don’t have a disagreement. If it’s dope, @ us on social so we don't miss it!

BUT, our logo and name are important, copyrighted parts of our brand, and we must protect them. So let’s go over a few ground rules.

## What Can I Do?
**✅👌🙂 You may:**
- ✅ Recreate, remix, create derivative artworks featuring the Möbiusband icon, with attribution.
- ✅ Buy and sell said derivatives, if you give attribution.

**🚫👎😰 You may not:**
- 🚫 Use our Brand Assets (logo, icon, name,) or any derivative works in any product/brand name, brand logo, etc. that can conflict or compete with BendDAO. For example:
  - Don’t make an NFT liquidity protocol called “BendLiquidity”
  - Don’t make an NFT exchange marketplace called “BendExchange”
  - Don’t make a digital art brand or product with a similarly-shaped Möbiusband logo with curves, even if it’s colored yellow or something.
  - Don’t make a product called “BendDAO Tools” or similar that may be misinterpreted as having an official relationship to BendDAO.
- 🚫 Use or remix any of our Brand Assets to imply an official relationship, partnership, or other endorsement where there is none.
- 🚫 Use the name “BendDAO” in full in social media channels in a way that implies any official relationship to us. If you make a fan group, Twitter account etc., make it clear that it’s not official.
- 🚫 Falsely claim or suggest any sort of official relationship, partnership, or other endorsement in any way.

## Logo Guidelines

### Logo Anatomy

### Logo Variations

## Logo Colors
Blue is BendDAO’s brand color. It’s vibrant, saturated, slightly acidic, and generally stands out because it’s great. We like the blue.

### Logo Restrictions
Common sense stuff really.

- Don’t move the icon to the left 
- Don’t remove the icon 
- Don’t change the text color 
- Don’t break up the name in the horizontal lockup (vertical lockup is unavoidable) 
- Don’t add drop shadows or distort the text 
- Don’t add outlines or other effects 
- Don’t change the typeface or otherwise reconstruct the logo
